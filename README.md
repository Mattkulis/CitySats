# CitySats
This is the construction of a site which will be a directory, marketplace, and literary intersection for BTC education.
As things currently sit I am learning how to implement the code which this site is intended to use.
I will likely turn it into a directory in the meanwhile. i hope to have this completed by end of february.
Regardless feel free to visit citysats.com which my partner owns. This site will be hosted by github and the url is citysats.store i aim to link the two sites to help people both acquire and sell btc as well as use it for real purchases in an offer up fashion.
