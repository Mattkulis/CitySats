# CitySats
This is the construction of a site which will be a directory, marketplace, and literary intersection for BTC education.
As things currently sit I am learning how to implement the code which this site is intended to use.
I will likely turn it into a directory in the meanwhile. i hope to have this completed by end of february.
Regardless feel free to visit citysats.com which my partner owns. This site will be hosted by github and the url is citysats.store i aim to link the two sites to help people both acquire and sell btc as well as use it for real purchases in an offer up fashion.

Some of the interesting things I would like to implement in a platform such as this:
atomic swaps for other digital assets
coinjoin
ln connectivity + use of chaumian ecash mints (think enuts/ Cashu)
Nostr
Civkit
all users get a universal identifier: the nostr pubkey > from here all different wallet addresses types can be linked tied to this one public identifier like (ENS)
so think the tethering of Bitcoin:duh, Bitcoin LNAddresses, XRP pubkey, XMR pubkey, Doge pubkey, filecoin, cardano... etc, with easy ability for interrexchange between ln (iou's) for other currencies. this is a way for users to cheaply secure "value" by receiving any currency of their choosing. 

Moving funds from the custodial ln addresses to other currencies temporarily, helps take strain off the BTC network and helps settle small transactions and consolidate UTXO's cheaply. This would theoretically give users have the ability to consolidate short term value (received shitcoins), which which they can use a coinjoin option of multiple digital currencies and convert them to LTSV: BTC the hardest of all. or if they want a jpeg, they convert to Eth, if they want to send something using ring signature, XMR...
this would be cool
LIkewise if this was dually a social media app where people could buy and sell and then instantly send other platform (nostr) users zaps then viral posts could theoretically be little gold mines that then get spent on physical items on the marketplace side, and around and around we go.
integration of digital communities would be fun too. little message boards users can see if they are connected to a certain relay. this gives the decentralization power to community organizers who choose to self-host their own communitie's nodes.
imagine combining IFPS and NOSTR now that would be an awesome combo: users pay zaps to the relay runner: an atomic swap converts filecoin miners to convert to sats and then the relay runners can use the filecoin to store their relay's data. :brings into question the confidentiality of data handling...
